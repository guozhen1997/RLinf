   Streaming Flow Policy, from the `StreamingVLA
   <https://github.com/gen-robot/StreamingVLA>`_ project.

Fine-tune a π₀.₅ checkpoint on LIBERO with the **Streaming Flow Policy (SFP)**
objective. SFP trains the action expert to follow an action *trajectory* rather
than denoise a whole action chunk, which is what lets a caller keep executing
while the next actions are still being produced. Only the objective changes:
the architecture, the parameter shapes, and the checkpoint layout stay those of
π₀.₅, so training starts from a stock ``pi05_libero`` checkpoint and its output
loads back into one.

Overview
--------

Train π₀.₅ on LIBERO demonstrations with the SFP objective, full-parameter, on one node.

| **You'll do:** install OpenPI → convert LIBERO → compute norm stats → convert the π₀.₅ checkpoint → launch ``run_vla_sft.sh`` → watch the training loss.
| **Prerequisites:** :doc:`Installation </rst_source/start/installation>` · disk space for the raw LIBERO RLDS data and its LeRobot copy.

.. warning::

   RLinf implements the SFP training objective only. Rollout, simulator
   evaluation, and RL need a trajectory sampler that does not exist yet, so
   ``actor.model.openpi.task`` values other than ``sft`` reject ``use_sfp``
   rather than quietly running the flow-matching sampler on an SFP checkpoint.

How Streaming Flow Policy Differs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A π₀.₅ model denoises an entire action chunk at once. Its flow time is a
denoising coordinate with no relation to robot time, so nothing in the chunk is
executable until every denoising step has run.

SFP integrates the chunk into a trajectory and maps the flow time onto it
instead. ``t=0`` is the action state the robot has already reached, ``t=1`` is
the end of the chunk, and the action expert regresses the trajectory velocity at
``t`` from a single suffix token. A policy trained this way can be integrated
forward from wherever it currently is.

Two settings in the recipe follow from that. ``actor.model.openpi.use_sfp``
selects the objective, and ``sfp_sigma`` with ``sfp_noise_decay`` control how
much noise is injected at the start of the trajectory and how quickly it decays
along it.

Prepare the Dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SFP needs one field that flow matching does not: ``action_states``, the running
total of the actions taken before each frame, which is where that frame's
trajectory begins. Download the public `OpenVLA modified LIBERO RLDS dataset
<https://huggingface.co/datasets/openvla/modified_libero_rlds>`_ and convert it:

.. code:: bash

   hf download openvla/modified_libero_rlds \
       --repo-type dataset \
       --local-dir /data/libero-rlds

   export HF_LEROBOT_HOME=/data/lerobot

   python toolkits/lerobot/convert_libero_data_to_lerobot.py \
       --data-dir /data/libero-rlds \
       --repo-name local/libero_sfp

The converter merges the four LIBERO suites into
``$HF_LEROBOT_HOME/local/libero_sfp`` and records ``action_states`` for every
frame. Pass ``--raw-dataset-names`` to convert a subset of the suites, and
``--overwrite`` to replace an existing dataset at that path.

.. note::

   ``--repo-name`` is resolved under ``HF_LEROBOT_HOME``; an absolute path is
   rejected. Keep ``HF_LEROBOT_HOME`` at the same value for the statistics step
   and for training, or the loader will not find the dataset.

Normalization Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The converted dataset still holds raw action units, so the next step measures
the scale the model trains in:

.. code:: bash

   python toolkits/lerobot/calculate_norm_stats.py \
       --config-name pi05_libero_sfp \
       --repo-id local/libero_sfp \
       --output-dir /data/assets/libero_sfp

This writes ``/data/assets/libero_sfp/norm_stats.json`` with statistics for
``state``, ``actions``, and ``action_states``. The last entry is a copy of
``actions``, because SFP sums the initial state and the action deltas into one
trajectory and the two therefore have to be scaled by the same numbers.

The same requirement is why SFP divides by ``max(|q01|, |q99|)`` instead of
using the affine quantile map OpenPI applies elsewhere: a pure scaling commutes
with the sum, so accumulating normalized deltas gives the same trajectory as
normalizing the accumulated one. An affine map shifts every value and breaks
that identity.

Installation
------------

.. include:: _setup_common.rst

SFP runs in the OpenPI environment; no separate install target is needed.

**Option 1: Docker image** — image tag ``agentic-rlinf0.4-maniskill_libero``:

.. code:: bash

   docker run -it --rm --gpus all \
      --shm-size 20g \
      --network host \
      --name rlinf \
      -v .:/workspace/RLinf \
      rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.4-maniskill_libero
      # Mainland China mirror: docker.1ms.run/rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.4-maniskill_libero

   # Inside the container, switch to the OpenPI virtual environment:
   source switch_env openpi

**Option 2: Custom environment** — install bundle ``--env maniskill_libero``:

.. code:: bash

   # Add --use-mirror for faster downloads in mainland China.
   bash requirements/install.sh embodied --model openpi --env maniskill_libero
   source .venv/bin/activate

Download the Model
------------------

Training starts from the official ``pi05_libero`` weights in RLinf's PyTorch
layout, a directory holding ``model.safetensors``. Download and convert them
from an `OpenPI <https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi>`_ checkout:

.. code:: bash

   python -c "from openpi.shared import download; download.maybe_download('gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi05_libero')"

   python examples/convert_jax_model_to_pytorch.py \
       --checkpoint_dir "$HOME/.cache/openpi/openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi05_libero" \
       --config_name pi05_libero \
       --output_path /data/checkpoints/pi05_libero_pytorch

Run It
------

**1. Configuration**

The recipe is split into a path-free model template,
``examples/sft/config/model/pi0_5_sfp.yaml``, and the experiment config,
``examples/sft/config/libero_sft_pi05_sfp.yaml``. Point the experiment config at
the three paths produced above:

.. code:: yaml

   data:
     train_data_paths: local/libero_sfp

   actor:
     model:
       model_path: /data/checkpoints/pi05_libero_pytorch
       openpi_data:
         norm_stats_path: /data/assets/libero_sfp/norm_stats.json

The model template selects the objective and the data pipeline together:

.. code:: yaml

   openpi:
     task: sft
     config_name: "pi05_libero_sfp"
     use_sfp: True
     sfp_sigma: 0.16
     sfp_noise_decay: 4.0

``config_name`` does double duty. It picks the OpenPI data config that repacks
and pads ``action_states``, and its name also selects the matching SFT data
loader.

The supplied recipe runs full-parameter FSDP on four GPUs with fp32 master
weights and bf16 compute.

.. warning::

   ``global_batch_size`` must stay a multiple of ``micro_batch_size`` times the
   world size, otherwise the actor rejects the config at startup.

**2. Launch**

.. code:: bash

   source .venv/bin/activate
   export HF_LEROBOT_HOME=/data/lerobot
   bash examples/sft/run_vla_sft.sh libero_sft_pi05_sfp

What this command does: 1. composes the Hydra config and starts a Ray cluster;
2. builds the π₀.₅ model with the SFP objective and loads the converted
checkpoint; 3. streams LIBERO through the SFP data pipeline and trains.

Visualization and Results
-------------------------

Monitor the **training loss** to confirm the model is fitting the
demonstrations. For every logged metric, see :doc:`Training metrics
<../../reference/metrics>`.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Launch TensorBoard
   tensorboard --logdir ./logs

``run_vla_sft.sh`` overrides ``runner.logger.log_path`` with a timestamped
directory, so checkpoints land in
``logs/<timestamp>-libero_sft_pi05_sfp/checkpoints/global_step_<N>/``. To
resume, point ``runner.resume_dir`` at one of them and relaunch.
